        Karate is a traditional Japanese martial art that originated on the
        island of Okinawa. It is known for its focus on self-defense and its
        ability to improve both physical and mental fitness. 

        Whether you are interested in learning self-defense or simply looking for a comprehensive form of exercise, karate has something to offer for everyone.

        Our club also practices a specific style of karate called Gijomon-kai. 

        This style was founded in 1977 by Yoshiji Kaku and introduced to Finland by Kim Isaksson in 1994. The name Gijomon means "duty first" or "destiny is to act towards one's duty" in English. 

        In our classes, you will learn a variety of punches, kicks, controls, throws, and falls, as well as how to apply them in self-defense situations.

        We invite you to join us on the mat and discover the benefits of practicing karate and Gijomon-kai for yourself.
