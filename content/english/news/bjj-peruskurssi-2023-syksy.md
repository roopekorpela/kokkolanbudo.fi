The basic course also works as a perfect refresher course if you are interested in returning to tatami, but the lessons have been forgotten.

No previous experience is required and no physical fitness is required. BJJ is suitable for both young and old regardless of age or gender.

The basic BJJ course introduces the basic techniques of the sport. In typical basic course workouts, you warm up and perform various body control movements, learn techniques in pairs and finally spar.

The duration of the course is about 2 months. The course fee of 100 â‚¬ includes the basic course and autumn season training with those who continue.
We accept Smartum, Epassi, Tyky, Tyky+ and Tyky online payments. The first two times you can try it out for free.

Indoor exercise clothes or a gi and a white belt are enough for the equipment. You can also get a Gi during the course, and you can get instructions on how to get it from the instructors.

The age limit for the basic course is 15 years, and the person participating in the course must have an impeccable background.
