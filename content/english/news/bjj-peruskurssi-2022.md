No previous experience is required and no iron fitness. BJJ is suitable for both young and old, regardless of age or gender.

BJJ's basic course introduces you to the basic techniques of the sport. In typical basic course exercise includes various body control movements which are first warmed up and then performed, techniques are learned in pairs, and finally sparring is done.

The duration of the course is about 2 months. The course fee of 100e includes the basic course and the rest of the year with those who continue training.
