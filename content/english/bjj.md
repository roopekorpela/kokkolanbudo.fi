        **Brazilian ju-jutsu or BJJ** is a martial and self-defense sport developed by brazilians Carlos and Hélio Gracie on the basis of traditional Japanese jujutsu and judo techniques.
        
        Brazilian jujutsu focuses on various martial arts techniques used in the country. In a typical match situation, the goal is to take the opponent to the ground as soon as possible, where the match will end with a lock or strangle.
